# chanalyze
A simple WhatsApp Chat Analyzer ( for both Private &amp; Group chats ), made with :heart:
## nomenclature
**Chat** _+_ **Analyze** _=_ **chanalyze**
## motivation
- I was interested in learning how much time I'm spending on WhatsApp _or_ in which conversation I'm more or less involved/ attached _or_ at which part of day I'm more involved in Chatting etc.
- So I'm writing these scripts for analyzing **WhatsApp** Chat _( both Private & Group )_, which can easily be exported into a _*.txt_ file from WhatsApp Mobile Application.
- That _*.txt_ is parsed, cleaned & objectified, so that it can be analyzed with ease.
- For sake of **Privacy** test data file(s), which were used for plotting following chart(s), are kept private.
